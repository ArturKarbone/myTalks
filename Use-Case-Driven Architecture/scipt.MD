Hello, my estonian friends

Thank you for answering me

Sit back, relax, it's not gonna be a technical brain fuck session. Just an easy going talk.
The worst thing might happen here - I will shit my pants on the stage.

Who is is fucking gipsy?

Part of RRA team in Riga

Participate in all stages of software delivery cycle - from a sale to an implementation.

Also failed stand-up comedian

It is not my first talk. So all my jokes are time-proven. Sometimes i'm A/B testing new jokes though.

So if you can't get one, I'm either A/B testing a new joke or you are stupid.

I feel that you wanna say - stop talking and show me the money

There are big names in our field. They have quite similar approaches.

You can call it Susan if it makes you happ, but under the hood there are a lot of similarities.

Yeah I steal jokes from Guy Ritchie, Elon Musk, mixed them and sell like my owns

I'm not an inventor, I just  distilled the based, coined the term. Repainted as a stolen car.

We already have a bunch of approaches, like N-Tier, MVC, etc.
They are not abandonden, with feature-driven you can get them to the next stage.

We don't ship these projects/libraries as something standalone. Why do we need so many?

Now image that you have to add a new field. Like customer consent to send them some news & updates. We don't have a single entry point. This customer class is everywhere. Now we have to patch 10+ projects. Low cohesion


Lets look at some commmon issues, you've all seen

Fancy frameworks, but the code still needs love


Just looking at the folders structure i can uderstand what my system is capable of
Where should i start to adjust my features.
