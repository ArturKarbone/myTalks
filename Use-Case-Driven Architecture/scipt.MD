Hello, my estonian friends

Thank You for answering me

Sit back, relax, It's gonna be no technical brain fuck session

The worst thing can happen here - I will shit my pants on the stage.

Who am I?

Part of RRA team in Riga

Participate in all parts of software delivery from sales to implementation.

Also failed stand-up comedian

It is not my first talk. So all my jokes are time-proven. Sometimes i'm A/B testing my new jokes.

Lets spred some light on Use-Case-Driven arhitecture.

Yeah I steal jokes from Guy Ritchie, Elon Musk, mixed them and sell like my owns

Fancy frameworkd, but the code still needs love
